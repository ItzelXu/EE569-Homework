# Folder Arrangement

###############################################################################
	Please put the input image and Ground Truth Images into the
	'Images' folder. Please DO NOT delete 'Images' Folder.
###############################################################################

# Folder 'Problem1' 
	It Contains the Source Code and Makefile for Problem1
	'Images' Folder should be used to store the Image Files for clear organization. Every Input Image including Original Image should be put into this folder.
	Please Do Not Remove this Folder.

# Folder 'Problem2'
	It Contains the Source Code and Makefile for Problem2
	'Images' Folder should be used to store the Image Files for clear organization. Every Input Image including Original Image should be put into this folder.
	Please Do Not Remove this Folder.

# Compile

# Problem1
	For compiling Problem1 source codes, you need to go into the 'Problem1' folder from your command window first.
	Then just use 'make all' command to compile all the source code into object file

# Problem2
	For compiling Problem2 source codes, you need to go into the 'Problem2' folder from your command window first.
	Then just use 'make all' command to compile all the source code into object file

# Run Code

###############################################################################
	Please Follow the Command Exactly as the Example Shows, the Name
	of the Output Images Matters to the Evaluation Process. 
	Please Don't Change them.
##############################################################################

# For Problem 1 a, run below command in your command window within 'Problem1' folder
	the command is './Problem1a'

# For Problem 1 b, run below command in your command window within 'Problem1' folder
	the command is './Problem1b'

# For Problem 1 c and 1 d, run below command in your command window within 'Problem1' folder
	the command is './Problem1c'
	#Note: You can change certain parameters to get different results. Also, the median filter function was realized by Matlab 2019b.

###############################################################################
	For Problem2, there is a Makefile in the folder 'Problem2', for easily 
	run all the commands below at same time. Just run below command in your 
	command window within 'Problem2' folder. Use 'make run' to run them.
###############################################################################

# For Problem 2 b, run below command in your command window within 'Problem2' folder
	the command is './Problem2b'

# For Problem 2 c, run below command in your command window within 'Problem2' folder
	the command is './Problem2c'

# Results
	For Problem 1, The result images will be created in the 'Images' folder. 
	For Problem 2, The result images will be created in the 'Images' folder. 
	Every program has its own output filename.
	
	The properties of key points and the Histogram of BoW are going to be displayed on your command window screen.

# Code Review
	The code's only hard coded part is the Reading image part. Please do not remove any folders.
	If there is any issues about the compiling and variables, please feel free to contact me.
